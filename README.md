# Installation

    git clone https://github.com/rdunlop/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles

Run one of the three installation options:

    rake install:dotfiles # Install the dotfiles and scripts
    rake install:spectacles # Install Spectacles.app config
    rake install:link_sublime # Sym-link/install SublimeText configurations
    rake install:brew      # Install homebrew packages and Mac defaults
    rake install          # Install all of the above (recommended)


## Configuration

1. Set up 1Password manager by using an existing 1password app (on your phone, for example), sync passwords.
1. Set up Keybase running `keybase login`
1. run `/Keybase/private/robindunlop/ssh_config/install.sh` to install the ssh keys
1. run `/Keybase/private/robindunlop/aws_config/  install.sh` to install the ssh keys

### macOS defaults

Some macOS defaults:

```bash
./.macos
```

### Install Homebrew-sourced programs

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
./brew.sh
```

Some of the functionality of these dotfiles depends on formulae installed by `brew.sh`. If you donâ€™t plan to run `brew.sh`, you should look carefully through the script and manually install any particularly important ones. A good example is Bash/Git completion: the dotfiles use a special version from Homebrew.
