# Find a docker-container, and attach to it
#
# To detach, by default this is Ctrl-P/Ctrl-Q
# but most people think that Control-C should do it, so we set that
# Ref: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach
#
# Note: in order to attach to a container, you must have it started
# with docker-compose settings:
#     tty: true
#     stdin_open: true

function docker-compose-attach() {
  docker attach $(docker-compose ps -q $1) --detach-keys="ctrl-c";
}
