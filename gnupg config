gnupg config
In order to install rvm:

https://github.com/rvm/rvm/issues/4215
- need to cerate a "~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf" file with "disable-ipv6" contents.

Need to install `brew install sha2` in order to install the `sha256sum` method, needed by the rvm install command for ruby.


After installing rvm, run `rvm autolibs rvm_pkg` before installing the ruby version.

and `rvm pkg install openssl` ?
